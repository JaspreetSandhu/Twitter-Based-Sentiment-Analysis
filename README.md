This project was developed by myself in 2019, in experimentation with concepts of web-scraping, data cleansing, and text processing. My aim with this project was to use the skills learned in a classroom environment and apply them to a more modern-day, real-world context, hence the integration of the social network 'Twitter'.

The program fundamentally serves as a sentiment analysis; handling real-life tweets which were scraped from the platform, and calculating their overall 'happiness score' using a selection of key-words from the english language. For the end user, this is depicted by an outflow of 'Regional Averages' for each of North America's 4 geographic zones, which were calculated by grouping tweets by measure of longitude & latitude.

Please feel free to explore the collection of files in the repository to get a better understanding of the specifics and logic that went into the algorithms!
